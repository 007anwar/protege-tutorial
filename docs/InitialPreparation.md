Initial Preparation
===================

### GitHub Login

Obtain a login at GitHub (<https://github.com/>) and send your login name so you can be added to the GO Organization (<https://github.com/geneontology>). This is our repository for ontology files and issue trackers.

### Clone this repository

Visit <https://github.com/geneontology/protege-tutorial>

click "Clone or Download"

This will give you a URL you can use

```
git clone https://github.com/geneontology/protege-tutorial.git
```

These files will be under `protege-tutorial` on your drive.

### Install Protege 5 for Ontology Development

Download and install the latest version of Protege (5.1) for ontology development.

The exercises assume that you have the tutorial directory checked out from GitHub. If for some reason youâ€™re unable to do this, you can download individual files from:
